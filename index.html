    <h2>Our Beliefs on Beauty</h2>
    <p>Inspired by the Japanese concept of yūgen, we believe beauty is profound, subtle, and timeless. True beauty is not about transformation; it’s about revealing and appreciating what already exists. We honor the elegance of simplicity, the power of natural aging, and the moments of quiet beauty that emerge over time. At Kamakuru, beauty is celebrated as a journey, not a destination—a blend of the seen and unseen, enriched by experience and rooted in authenticity.</p>
